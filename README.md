## Tech Stack
- **Django 5.2.6** - Web framework
- **MySQL** - Database
- **Bootstrap 5** - Frontend styling
- **Chart.js** - Analytics charts
- **JavaScript** - Dynamic interactions
- **Python 3.12** - Programming language

## Major Improvements & Bug Fixes

### 🔧 Fixed Issues
- **Django Admin Separation**: Restored default `/admin/` untouched; moved custom admin APIs to `/admin-api/` and updated namespace to `admin_api`
- **Admin URL Conflicts**: Fixed `NoReverseMatch` by updating all `admin:` links to `admin_api:` in templates and views
- **Restaurant Reverse Relations**: Replaced `restaurant.meals` with `restaurant.meal_set` where needed
- **Owner Access Lockdown**: Owners cannot access other restaurants by URL guessing (404 on mismatch)
- **Cart Script Duplication**: Prevent duplicate `CartManager` initialization and removed extra script includes
- **Cart & Checkout Images**: Show real meal images with graceful fallback icons
- **Charts**: Fixed User Distribution chart init and data loading in custom admin dashboard
- **Add Meal Flow**: Admins select restaurant or pass `/add-meal/<id>/`; owners unaffected
- **Restaurant Settings**: Dynamic per-restaurant settings `/restaurants/settings/<id>/` with selection for admins
- **Dashboard Navigation**: All sidebar/action links now context-aware (Overview, Orders, Manage Meals, Settings)
- **Dashboard Meal Actions**: Edit/Delete buttons work directly from dashboard list
- **Order Pages Consistency**: Checkout success timeline matches order tracking status logic

### 🚀 New Features
- **Multi-stage Order Status**: Complete workflow with proper role separation
- **Real-time Delivery Dashboard**: Auto-refresh with sound notifications for new orders
- **Enhanced Profile Pages**: Role-specific content and functionality
- **Professional Order Management**: Working modals, status updates, and notifications

## Common Issues

**Database Connection Error?**
- Make sure MySQL is running
- Check database credentials in `settings.py`
- Install `mysqlclient` package

**Charts Not Showing?**
- Charts load dynamically from API endpoints
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure Chart.js is loading properly

**Delivery Dashboard Empty?**
- Make sure user role is set to 'delivery'
- Check that orders exist with status 'confirmed' or 'preparing'
- Verify API endpoints are working

**Can't Update Order Status?**
- Check user permissions for the specific action
- Ensure CSRF token is included in AJAX requests
- Verify order is in correct status for transition

## Development Notes

- All charts use Chart.js with dynamic data loading
- AJAX requests include CSRF protection
- Role-based decorators prevent unauthorized access
- Order status transitions follow a strict flow
- Real-time updates use polling (can be upgraded to WebSockets)

## What's New (This Sprint)
- Separated default Django admin from custom admin panel to remove conflicts
- Introduced per-restaurant routing for dashboard, orders, meals, and settings
- Added a generic restaurant selection page for admin actions
- Hardened owner authorization on all restaurant and order endpoints
- Fixed cart and checkout images to use uploaded meal images
- Unified order status UI across success and tracking pages

## Future Enhancements
- **WebSocket Integration**: Replace polling with real-time WebSocket notifications
- **Payment Gateway**: Integrate Stripe/PayPal for actual payment processing  
- **Mobile App**: Create React Native/Flutter app using Django REST API
- **GPS Tracking**: Real-time delivery tracking with maps integration
- **Advanced Analytics**: Revenue forecasting, customer behavior analysis
- **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization for different markets
- **Email Notifications**: Order confirmations and status updates via email
- **Rating System**: Customer reviews and restaurant ratings
